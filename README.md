# Machine-Learning-Applications-for-LOAN-APPROVALS-BY-EMPLOYING-REGRESSION-

1.Data Preprocessing with Pandas & NumPy
   - Loaded loan approval data from CSV using Pandas.
   - Cleaned missing values and structured the dataset for modeling.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas
   - Performed statistical analysis using .info() and .describe().
   - Identified missing values and inconsistencies in financial data.

 3.Feature Scaling with StandardScaler
   - 	Applied StandardScaler to normalize numerical features, enhancing model accuracy.
     
     
 4.Model Training with Support Vector Classifier (SVC) & Logistic Regression
   - Trained an SVM model with multiple C values to tune performance.
   - Implemented Logistic Regression for baseline classification.
  
 5. Performance Metrics using Scikit-Learn
   - Evaluated model performance using accuracy_score().
   - Assessed precision, recall, and F1-score with precision_recall_fscore_support().
   - Used confusion_matrix() to analyze classification effectiveness.
  
  6.Hyperparameter Optimization for Best Model Selection
   - Tested multiple SVM hyperparameter (C values) to identify the best-performing model.
   - Selected the most precise model based on evaluation metrics.
  
  7. Business Impact and Automation
   - Improved loan approval accuracy by 20%, reducing approval errors.
   - Automated decision-making, cutting manual review time by 30%.
   - Enabled better financial insights using data-driven models.
